1. Create a basic project that has an index.html at the root with a css and js folder at the same location. Inside of these folders create a style.css file in the css folder and the script.js file within the js folder.

2. Create a header that contains your full name on the left hand side and the at the right hand side contains links that will go directly to home, to a page name myjobs.html, and a page name about.html. Make sure when you click on the links that they move to a different page. Make sure that the header has a padding of 2vw on the left and the right. It should not strecth the screen so there should be no scrolling horizontal bars. The title should be a font-size of your name greater than 28px. Make sure the header has a border at the bottom.

3.  Create a side bar that contains an unordered list (<ol></ul> which should contain the same links you have in the header. The sidebar should be about 30% of the width of the page and make the height of the element 700px long. Have a border on the right side.

4. Create a main div that will hold our form later on. You can live it blank for now. Make sure the main div is 700px also and lines perfectly with the side bar.

5. Create footer at the bottom of the page that contains very simple contact information on you. Also have a border top.
